# Reflections
  Under the [Trial by the Judges](33:53-34:14), the contradictive part is if Parker isn't killed, the Trial won't exist at all.

  - ## on [utilitarianism theory](27:10-30:00)

    - pleasure over pain
      - The first solution

    - The moto

      > **greatest good** for **greatest number** new thing?

      - I think more correctly

        > **greatest chance** that **greatest good** for **greatest number** new thing?

        - people consider a lot more about the expected value rather than the sum

    - it's a retrospect consideration on analysis

    - it's a illusion or confusion on persuasion
      - the utility you acquire, through a particular decision is unknown
        - only time will tell, when the utility is realized
      - examples: ADs,insurance

    - it basically formulates the idea of negotiation
      - rather only showing the need of yourself
      - help others understand why they are benefited.
        - even under a illusion of utility.

  - ## The Judge's consideration

    - What they said is actually what happened
      - we knew the outcome, but not the judge
      - they could just pair up a story, and make everything looked like an accident

    - Are they mentally ill
      - maybe they are hallucinated

    - There are no precedence on such case
      - the respective judge will be taken the first blame.

    - Killing a person with a pen knife under a starvation conditions
      - It is not convincingly possible

    - The age/lifespan of the victim

  - ## The parties consideration

    - why would you tell the truth at the first place?
      - about the lottery, murder, ...
      - there are no witness except for themselves

    - the attitude of **no dispute**
      - suggest self-righteous

  - ## The Social consideration

    - as stated by the newspaper
      - they get the sympathy

  - ## to responses

    - ## [Defense Response 2](35:50-36:50)

      - Everybody have a risk to be a bad guy
        - it doesn't mean it's not worth it to make them alive.
      - keeping more people alive generally is economically viable.

    - ## [Lottery Response 2](43:50-44:38)

      - a lottery involves risk and reward
        - the game is, not necessarily fair at the first place
        - the value of people consider continual living is different.

      - realistically, the lottery
        - is fair for the one who comes up with the idea

      - and a lottery is short, unfair, decision
        - asked 4 person to have a mutual conclusion decided on pure luck
        - there are no way to make a fair statement.

    - ### [Even with ... still wrong 1](47:15-48:13)
      - remorse
        - having breakfast
        - it is at some point a humor
          - it's also the punishment they have to live with for the rest of their life.

      - the victim is an orphan
        - there were nothing for him to lose further, except for his dream.


  - ## theories on why [killing is categorically wrong](51:30-54:56)

    > 1. Do we have certain fundamental rights?

      - right is a comparison, relative
        - usually you realize **after** you were **deprived**
        - and many rights are often assumed 

      - right to be informed, understood
        - understanding the right you have

    > 2. Does a fair procedure justify any result

      - a fair procedure doesn't always produce fair result
        - 1-people 1 vote is fair mathematically only,

      - the definition of fair easily put people into `circular reasoning`.

    > 3. What is the moral work of consent

      - consent is not a fair concept at the first place
        - assume people are greedy.
